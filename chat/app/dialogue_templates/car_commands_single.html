{#         <h1> In the picture at the left, please record the command you would give a car system. Click the "Record" button to start recording, and then "Stop" once you have finished recording. If you want to rerecord your statement, just delete the original recording and repeat the procedure. Once you have finalized your recording, hit "Send Response" to send it to our servers.</h1>#}
        <p>Your work will greatly contribute to a scientific research project related to the building a computer you can talk to and interact with. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Imagine that you are in a car that has a built-in entertainment system that you can talk with, and it will perform the car-related commands you give it.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will be shown an image of some action being performed in a car. Your task is to record the audio of what you would say to a car system to have it perform the task portrayed in the image.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you have decided what you would say to a car system to have it perform the task described, click the "Record" button. The button will turn <font color="red">red</font> while it is recording.
            </li>

            <li>
              Once you have finished recording, click the "Stop" button. An audio file of the recorded command will appear below the button.
            </li>

            <li>
              Please play the recorded audio to ensure that the command you wanted to give the car is clearly recorded. If it is not, click the "Delete" button located below the audio file link and record a new piece of audio.

            </li>

            <li>
              Once you are happy with the command you have recorded, complete the task by hitting the "Send Response" button. This will send the audio to our servers and redirect you to the next task.
            </li>
          </ol>


        <p> As an example of what we are looking for, consider the image below. Recording <b>either</b> of the following commands
        would be perfectly acceptable:</p>

          <ul>
              <li>
                  Take me to the nearest gas station.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Drive me to a place where I can get gas.
              </li>
          </ul>
